# EncodingWords
Word encoder and decoder written in Java

To do:
- Move the progress meter to a new class with a new method to keep the main method in Runner clear
- Experiment with reading in one book as an array and then outputting it to the terminal to show it works
- 
- May need to add some search functionality to search around the project folder for a text file
- Alternatively, could give a list of all the books in a book folder (not to be included with final project)
